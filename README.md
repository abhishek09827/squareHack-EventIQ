### About the Project
- [Project Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PF3R0wBjrNUkqlOAMNE0TCCY2vFfbP2D/view?usp=sharing)

### Inspiration
The motivation for our event booking application stemmed from the desire to streamline the event planning and attendance process. Observing the often fragmented and cumbersome experience associated with event discovery, ticket purchasing, and attendee networking, our team was inspired to create a unified platform that simplifies these elements. Our goal was to leverage cutting-edge technology, particularly AI, to personalize user experiences and foster community among event-goers.

### What it does
Our app revolutionizes the way users discover, attend, and experience events. It offers:

- **Event Discovery**: Users can find events based on their interests using AI-driven recommendations.
- **Smart Ticketing**: Seamless ticket purchasing and management.
- **Personalized Itineraries**: Custom schedules created based on user preferences and history.
- **Networking Facilitation**: AI-based matchmaking that connects attendees with similar interests.
- **Venue Analysis from Images**: Provides insights into event venues based on uploaded images, analyzing aspects like capacity and suitability for certain event types.
- **Random Event Generation**: Uses AI to creatively generate unique event ideas, fostering inspiration and diversity in event planning.

### How we built it
The application is built on a robust tech stack:

- **Frontend**: FlutterFlow for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Flask and ROWY for server-side logic.
- **Database**: Firebase for storing user data and event details.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Integrated Square APIs for payment processing and customer data management, and utilized a language model (Gemini) for generating content and analyzing text.

### Challenges we ran into
We encountered several challenges:

- **Integration Complexity**: Combining multiple APIs (Square and Gemini) posed significant integration challenges due to differing data formats and response times.
- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Ensuring the language model accurately understood and responded to user queries required extensive training and fine-tuning.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Seamless Integration**: Successfully integrating multiple APIs into a cohesive platform.
- **Innovative Features**: Our app enhances event discovery with AI-driven recommendations, facilitates secure ticket purchases, generates personalized itineraries, and uses a proprietary matchmaking algorithm to connect attendees based on shared interests, significantly improving networking opportunities.

### What we learned
This project was a tremendous learning opportunity, particularly in areas of:

- **Advanced AI Applications**: Deepened our understanding of natural language processing and its practical applications.
- **API Integration**: Gained insights into building flexible, scalable systems that integrate multiple external services smoothly.
- **User-Centric Design**: Learned the importance of user feedback in shaping product features and interfaces.

### What's next for EventIQ
Looking forward, we plan to:

- **Expand Event Categories**: Broaden the range of event types available, accommodating more niche interests and activities.
- **Enhance AI Features**: Improve the AI's accuracy and response time, and introduce multilingual support.
- **Increase Market Reach**: Extend our services to new geographical locations and demographics.
